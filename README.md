# Passport Photo Generator

This project is a web application built with React and Tailwind CSS that allows users to upload an image, adjust its brightness and contrast, crop it to passport size, and download the formatted passport photos. The application uses the `react-easy-crop` library for cropping and HTML5 Canvas for image adjustments.

## Features

- Upload an image
- Preview and adjust the image brightness and contrast in real-time
- Crop the image to passport size (3.5 cm x 4.5 cm)
- Generate a sheet of passport photos
- Download the generated passport photo sheet with a black border
